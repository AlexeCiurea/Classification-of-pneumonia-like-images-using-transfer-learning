# VGG16-Detection-Prediction_chestimages
Transfer learning using VGG16, Keras and TensorFlow to detect and predict the pneumonia disease.

## Dataset

<div align=center><img width="500" src="./images/pneumon-normal.PNG"/></div>


The input data is feed into the model using 240 chest X-ray images taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) where 120 labeled normal and 120 labeled with pneumonia to output the probability of each thoracic disease.
We reserved 80% of the data for training (20% of 80% for validation) and 20% for testing:
